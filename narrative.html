Intro 

South Africa is in the grip of what most experts say is the most severe drought the country has experienced in at least 25 years, if not longer. Respected climate scientist Bob Scholes of the Wits Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute says that the current drought is "one of the biggest drought events in living memory"[1]. Nationally dam levels this week are 17% lower than they were a year ago and key storage dams such as the Vaal Dam are almost completely depleted.




Deepening Crisis

The gauges below compare the current dam levels within each of South Africa's provinces with the dam levesl at the same time last year. Lesotho is also included as it is home to the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, a key component in SA's water management strategy. Of the nine provinces only the North West current dam levels are higher than last year, albeit by a slight margin. 

Note: These levels ar merely indicative of the stats of dams in each province, and not necessarily the amount of water each province has. Gauteng dam levels, for example, sit at close to 80% of full capacity, and yet the province is facing severe water restrictions. The reason is that Gauteng has just a couple of storage dams and relies on the major dams in the Free State for the majority of its water. 


 Saving Up for a (Less) Rainy Day
 
 Receiving just a fraction of the annual rainfall most other countries in the world do South Africa is heavily reliant on its ability to capture and store water for leaner times. To this end the Department of Water and Sanitation manages a network of 210 dams around the country that make up the bulk of SA's water management strategy. While the majority of these dams are located in the Eastern and Western Cape it is provinces like the Free State that play the largest role in managing the water risk the country faces.
 
 
 The Key Dams
 
 Of the 210 dams it is just a handful that make up the bulk of South Africa's water storage capacity. In the chart below the ten largest dams account for 64% of the country's storage. Their individual contribution to overall storage is also indicated. The other 200 dams account for the remaining 36%.
