<p>South Africa is a water-scarce country with one of the lowest annual rainfall figures in the world (see below). The country regularly experiences periods of severe drought which by some accounts are becoming increasingly severe. Respected climate scientist Bob Scholes of the Wits Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute said in early 2016 that the conditions at that time might well be <a href="https://africacheck.org/2016/02/03/frequently-asked-questions-about-south-africas-drought/">one of the biggest drought events in living memory"</a>. While the 2015/2016 water shortages were extreme the period that followed, from late 2016 to early 2017, saw even worse conditions with major dams such as the Vaal dam dropping to extreme lows.</p>

<p>At the start of 2016 for example, the Vaal dam was approximately 54% of its full storage capacity (FSC). By mid-November 2016 the dam was perilously close to dry at 26%. Good rains in the December to February have rapidly boosted the state of the Vaal  dam, so much so that now there are <a href=“flood warnings”>flood warnings</a> for residents in the flood plain below the dam as it reaches full capacity. </p>

Despite the strong rains in the north of the country the Western Cape is still deep in the drought and its dams are disturbingly close to being dry. At the time of writing (25 February 2017) the Western Cape’s largest storage dam, Theewaterskloof, was just 28% full. The week before it was 30% full. And a year before that it was almost 44% of its full storage capacity.<p>


<div class="content-title">Extremes</div>
<p>One of the characteristics of the current water crises has been its extreme nature. In the midst of the worst of the drought in Gauteng, for example, large parts of the province experienced major flooding resulting in massive infrastructure damage and even death. On November 9, 2016 large parts of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni experienced <a href=“https://www.enca.com/south-africa/reserve-water-supply-released-to-counter-crisis-in-gauteng”>flash floods</a>. At the same time the the major dams supplying the region were at all-time lows. In the same week water authorities began releasing water from the Sterkfontein dam to replenish the Vaal dam to avert a potential crisis.</p>
